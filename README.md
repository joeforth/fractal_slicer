# fractal_slicer
Initial implementation of slicer with flow control for producing vasculature-like fractal structures.

This currently runs out-of-the-box using a a jupyter notebook (fractal_slicer_v0-2.ipynb) as a frontend that runs the scripts in ./fracprint. 

Instructions can be found in printer_howto.docx
